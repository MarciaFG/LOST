# DATA FOLDER

In this folder, you can put data sources that can be shared across multiple languages, or for particularly niche applications. You will need to submit a [Git Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request), to get it incorporated into the master LOST branch.

Ideally, the same data set can be applied to all language Implementations on a LOST page. So upload files here in formats that can be generally loaded in multiple languages (perhaps CSV), or multiple versions of the same file for languages that don't play nicely with non-native formats.

Data should be stored in a subfolder titled with the name of the relevant LOST page you will be linking from. For example `Data/Ordinary-Least-Squares/OLSdata.csv`.
