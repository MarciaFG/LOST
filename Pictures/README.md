# PICTURES FOLDER README

In this folder you can put pictures to show on a LOST page. Pictures might be useful to demonstrate particular data formatting, or to show the output of data visualizations. You will need to submit a [Git Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to get it incorporated into the master LOST branch.

Pictures should be stored in a subfolder titled with the name of the relevant LOST page you will be linking from. If your picture is relevant to one of the Implementations, include the language in the picture's filename. For example `Pictures/Scatterplot/Python_scatterplot.png`.
